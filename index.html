						<h2>You Need Your Window Painted.</h2>
					</header>
					<p><strong>Kilkenny Signs</strong> hand painted window splash art serving the Portland, Oregon metro area and beyond. Call today! <strong>555.555.5555</strong></a>. Why settle for just a sign on your storefront when you can turn the whole storefront into a sign? You’re spending money renting your location, so why shouldn’t you get maximum return from it. One of the easiest ways to do this is to add window splashes that tie into the message and extend the visual impact of your storefront.

						FEATURE YOUR BEST SELLING POINT
						What can they say? Almost anything, but here’s a short list of possibilities:
						
						Products or services
						A graphic that relates, like a bike, a car, a new boat or a ninja warrior
						Secondary copy that you want to get off the primary sign, such as Commercial/Residential/Industrial or All Makes and Models
						A slogan, promise or guarantee statement
						Repeat your logo</p>

						<h2>Why paint your windows?</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Painted windows cost less than other forms of advertising and are proven to be effective. They draw attention and meet your customers at the point of sale! Your business. No other form of advertising offers 24/7 constant exposure. Window painting increases awareness in your business especially if it's tucked away or surrounded by other businesses. Window painting will increase your sales and profits. Isn't this what every business needs? 
						With so much of life taking place online these days, like social media platforms focused on local communities, why would businesses invest time and money in window splash advertising? However using window painting to promote a wide range of businesses; including retailers, artisan studios, and service providers, is finding that a modern take on this old school approach to advertising both spruces up their storefronts and keeps their cash registers ringing. Here are just a few of the benefits of window sign painting:
It is proven to increase sales by promoting brand recognition/retention and boosting word-of-mouth advertising.
It is less expensive than TV, print and radio advertisements, but unlike social media blasts, reaches potential customers’ eyes in moments when their attention is relatively undivided (for example, during an evening walk).
It greatly improves the visibility of small shops with limited street frontage.
It serves multiple purposes—for example, catching the eyes of pedestrians while providing privacy for customers inside the store.
Unlike with sandwich boards, awning signs or storefront banners, painted window signs require no special permit in most cases.
And if that wasn’t enough, when applied to company vehicles, painted window signs become free mobile advertising seen by commuters all over town! </p>

						<h2>About the service</h2>
					</header>
					<p>My work is made to look good from far away and to attract attention to your business and give information to potential customers.
						I do my best work when clients tell me to, "Fill it up and make it big and bold!"
					My windows just kinda form as I go a long. It's like a puzzle I'm trying to figure out. I don't pre-think or do any sketches. Window cleaning and fixing any and all problems or touch ups are included in the service. It has been documented that the sign industry was a byproduct of efforts to brand and badge products in the late 19th century. Sign painters used quills and oil-based paint on signboards, store windows, fabric awnings and more. In those days, the painter was the marketing expert—advertising agencies did not exist. In fact, a sign painter designed the Ford and Coca-Cola logos still in use today!

					It takes an expert hand to make anything other than a mess with a quill dipped in oil paint. But with fluorescent paint and foam brushes our artists can produce clean lines and eye-catching designs.
